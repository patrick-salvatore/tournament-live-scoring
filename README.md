## Prerequisites

- A Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, etc.)

## Installations

1. **Download Go**:
   Visit the [Go downloads page](https://golang.org/dl/) and download the latest version for your operating system.

2. **Install Go**:
   Follow the installation instructions based on your OS:

   - **macOS**:
     ```bash
     brew install go
     ```

   - **Windows**:
     Follow the installer instructions provided on the Go downloads page.

3. **Verify Installation**
   
   After installation, check if Go is installed correctly by running:
   ```bash
   go version
   ```

4. **Install Air for Dev**
    ```bash
    go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest
    ```

5. **Configure Your Shell**
  
    - Using PATH. Locate the Go Bin Directory, typically located in $HOME/go/bin.
      ```bash
      export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin
      ```
  
    - Using shell alias
      ```bash
      alias air='~/go/bin/air'
      ```

6. **Verify Air Installation**:
  After installation, check if Go is installed correctly by running:
  ```bash
  air -version
  ```

## Running Dev Server
```bash
  cd api 
  air
```

OR 

```bash
  make
```

## Creating Migrations
1. Create the migration with `make db-create-migration`
2. edit the sql file with the change to the table
3. execute the migration with `make db-migrate-up`
4. within `db/queries` find the file named with the table that was modified from the migration (or create one if the file doesnâ€™t exist) and modify the (or create) sql statements for the CRUD operations
5. Run make `db-generate`. This will execute the code-gen and create go functions you can use in the request handlers
